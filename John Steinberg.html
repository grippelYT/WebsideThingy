<p style="text-align:center;">John Ernst Steinbeck was an American writer. <br>
He won the 1962 Nobel Prize in Literature for his realistic and imaginative writings. <br>
He has been called "a giant of American letters".<br>
John Steinbeck was born on February 27, 1902, in Salinas, California. <br>
He lived in a small rural valley set in some of the world's most fertile soil, <br>
about 25 miles (40 kilometers) from the Pacific Coast. <br>
He spent summers working on nearby ranches. He later labored with migrant workers on <br>
Spreckels sugat beet farms. There he learned the harsher aspects of migrant life and the <br>
darker side of human nature, which supplied him with material expressed in "Of Mice and Men".
